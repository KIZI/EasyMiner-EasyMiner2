# EasyMiner-MiningUI

The main purpose of this subproject is the rendering of the main data mining interface in the [EasyMiner Project](http://easyminer.eu). 
The rendered MiningUI is based on JavaScript using Mooml/Mootools. 

**EasyMiner-MiningUI** is currently a submodule in the [EasyMiner-EasyMinerCenter](https://github.com/KIZI/EasyMiner-EasyMinerCenter).
